        <h3>6.1.1 Energy Stores</h3>
        
        <p>In our daily lives, we come across and require different kinds of energy for efficient living. Energy can be described as being in different ‘stores’. Each energy store can be associated with a system in which its elements possess the energy store or interact through the transfer of energy between energy stores.</p>
        
        <p>The SI unit of Energy is the joule (J). Energy is a scalar quantity.</p>
        
        <p>Examples of energy stores are:</p>
        
        
        <table align="center">
            <tr align="center"><th>Energy Store</th><th>Example of System</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Kinetic store</td><td>Object in motion</td><td><p>Energy that a body has due to its movement.</p>
$$E_k = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$
<p>where 	$E_k$: energy in the kinetic store (in J)
<br>$m$: mass of the body (in kg)
<br>$v$: speed of the body (in m s<sup>–1</sup>)

            <tr><td>Gravitational potential store</td><td>Object and the Earth</td><td><p>The energy that a body has due to its position above the reference level.</p>

$$E_p = mgh$$

<br>$m$: mass of the body (in kg)
<br>$g$: gravitational field strength (in N kg<sup>–1</sup>)
<br>$h$: height above reference level (in m)

Gravitational potential energy is assumed to be 0 J at a reference level that is usually the lowest point (e.g. ground).

        <h3>6.1.2 Conservation of Energy</h3>

        <blockquote>Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be transferred from one store to another.  The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.</blockquote>
        
        <p>The principle of the conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This means that the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time. To apply this principle to new situations or solve related problems, identify all forms of energy involved, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, or chemical energy. Calculate the initial and final energies, ensuring they are equal, accounting for energy transfers or transformations. For example, in a roller coaster, the gravitational potential energy at the highest point converts into kinetic energy as it descends, and vice versa, while the total energy remains constant. By understanding and tracking these energy changes, you can solve a wide range of physics problems accurately.</p>
        
        
        <table width="100%"><tr><td>
            <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>A 5.0 kg object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Assuming there is no air resistance, calculate the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground using the principle of conservation of energy.</p>
        
        <button id="btn1" data-div="ans2" onclick="reveal(this)">Reveal Answer</button>
        <div id="ans2" style="display:none">
            <p>The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy remains constant. Here, the potential energy at the height is converted into kinetic energy just before impact.</p>
            <p>Potential Energy (PE) at height, $PE = mgh = 5.0 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 10 \text{ m} = 490 \text{ J}$</p>
            <p>Kinetic Energy (KE) just before impact, $KE = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = PE$</p>
            <p>So, $\dfrac{1}{2} \times 5.0 \text{ kg} \times v^2 = 490 \text{ J}$</p>
            <p>$v^2 = \dfrac{490 \text{ J}}{2.5 \text{ kg}} = 196 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2$</p>
            <p>$v = \sqrt{196 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 14 \text{ m/s}$</p>
            <p>Therefore, the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground is 14 m/s.</p>
